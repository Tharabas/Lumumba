Cocoa best practice extensions

=== 

Lumumba contains a disjoint set of features

--- 
Extensions to standard Objective-C classes (Categories)

---
A thin layer for geometric calculus

---
Own UI components, for use with MacOS and iOS

---
Some Objective-C Sugar

---
*DISCLAIMER*

All those components, snippets and code fragments have been created,
because I either used them very often and thought, there should be
an easier way to do this, or because I simply did not know that there
is another way to do this in Objective-C.

I do neither claim all things to be flawless nor perfect to fit _your_ Apps.

Constructive comments are welcome, anytime, though.
